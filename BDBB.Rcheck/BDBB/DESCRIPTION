Description: 
    this study proposed a novel biclustering algorithm BDBB. In the process of algorithm
    design, the Gibbs sampler is employed to estimate the site label.
    In view of the absence of a conjugate prior distribution of the
    beta distribution, the method of moment estimation is cleverly
    introduced in the process of parameter estimation of the beta
    distribution
